## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Search for GitHub users by their username
-   See relevant user information based on their search
-   Switch between light and dark themes
-   **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

While working through this project I had the possibility to improve my knowledge about how to interact with 3rd-party API.
I learnt how to create an interface that describes what is in the response, how to create a function to fetch the data from the API and how to handle errors.
The project also gave me the possibility to practise using react-hook-form.

### Continued development

I will improve my knowledge about Promises, how to handle Errors and practising with APIs.

### Useful resources

-   [React-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started#Registerfields) - This is a fantastic library that allows me to build better forms .
